# Small cryptocurrency projects 

This repo contains a few small projects that implement the coinmarketcap API, details on each project to follow!

Have already included some small scripts as part of a "play-around" to see the capabilities of the API

## Prerequisites

- coinmarketcap API key: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ 
- Python 3.7+ (f-strings being used in scripts)

### Configuration file

Once an API key has been obtained, a `config.py` file will need to be created in order to be able to run all scripts within this repo as they will pull the api key from this file.

All that will need to be added to this file is `API_KEY=<insert api key here>`

## Running the scripts

A virtual environmennt can be created unless otherwise all the required packages and python version is already installed. A requirements.txt file is already included should you create a virtual environment.

# Small cryptocurrency projects 

This repo contains a few small projects that implement the coinmarketcap API, details on each project to follow!

Have already included some small scripts as part of a "play-around" to see the capabilities of the API

## Prerequisites

- coinmarketcap API key: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ 
- Python 3.7+ (f-strings being used in scripts)

## Running the scripts

A virtual environmennt can be created unless otherwise all the required packages and python version is already installed. A requirements.txt file is already included should you create a virtual environment.
